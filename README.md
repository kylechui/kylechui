## Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I _sometimes_ do interesting things! :wave:

I am a:

- Student: Third year CS major @ UCLA
- Learner: Experimenting with a few languages, mostly C++, Lua, Haskell, Python
  - I've recently become interested in using ideas from math to write programs
    that are "less wrong", i.e. types, functional programming, formal methods,
    etc.
  - I'm also currently learning more about quantum programming :rocket:
- Open Source Developer: I'm currently the creator/maintainer for
  [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround)
- Enthusiast: [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) nerd
  ([config here](https://github.com/kylechui/config.nvim))
